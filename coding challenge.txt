coding 1:
Create a simple task management application using Laravel. The application should have the following features:

User authentication and authorization
Ability to create, read, update, and delete tasks
Ability to assign tasks to users
Ability to set task due dates
Ability to mark tasks as complete
A task list view that shows all tasks, grouped by due date and sorted by priority
A task detail view that shows the task's details, including the assigned user and due date
A user profile view that shows the user's tasks, grouped by due date and sorted by priority
Additional constraints:

Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features
Use a database (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store the tasks and users
Use Laravel's built-in validation to ensure that the task data is valid before saving it to the database
Use Laravel's built-in pagination to display the tasks in the task list view.
This is a basic example of a coding challenge, you could add more constraints or features to it.

coding 2:

Task: Create a simple CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) application using Laravel.

The application should have a single model called "Task" with the following fields: "id", "name", "description", "completed".
The application should have a single controller called "TaskController" that handles all CRUD operations for the "Task" model.
The application should have views for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
The application should have proper validation in place for creating and updating tasks.
The application should have proper error handling in place for any potential issues that may arise.
Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features to restrict access to certain pages and actions.
This should cover most of the basic functionalities that a simple CRUD application should have.


coding (laravel and vue-js):


ask: Create a simple task management application using Laravel as the back-end and Vue.js as the front-end.

Back-end:

Create a new Laravel project.
Create a new task model with fields for name, description, and completed (boolean).
Create a task resource controller to handle CRUD operations for tasks.
Create a new migration for the tasks table and seed the table with some dummy data.
Create a new task service to handle any necessary business logic.
Create a new task API endpoint that returns all tasks in the database.
Front-end:

Create a new Vue.js project.
Create a new task component to display a list of tasks.
Use axios to fetch the tasks from the API endpoint created in the back-end.
Display the tasks in the task component using v-for.
Add a button to each task to toggle the completed field and update the task in the back-end using axios.
Add a form to the task component to create new tasks and send a post request to the back-end to create the new task.
Note: This is a simple example and can be enhanced with more feature or functionality.
